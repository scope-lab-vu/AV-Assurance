# Artifact Database

This repo has the sample [data files](https://github.com/scope-lab-vu/AV-Assurance/Artifacts/Data%20Files) and the [mapping file](https://github.com/scope-lab-vu/AV-Assurance/blob/main/Artifacts/mapping%20file.yml) that were generated by our workflow. The artifact ontology graph for the AV case study is shown below. The graph is derived from the mapping file.
